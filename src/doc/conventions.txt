Do not commit text files with tab characters.  Your editor should have a
setting to automatically convert tabs to spaces.  If not, then use
"expand" (available for all UNIXes + Cygwin) or any other home-made or
off-the-shelf tab-expander.

Don't use liberal import statements.  Include just what you need to
prevent unnecessary name collisions in the future.

Be conservative with white space.

When making a new file, copy the Copyright (and file Id$) boilerplate from
an existing file of the same type, and update the Copyright date if necessary.

Use block indents of 2 spaces for all *.xml files (incl. *.xsl and *.dtd),
and for HTML code in *.html, *.jsp, or fragment files (because of the copious
nesting of HTML).

Use block indents of 4 for all other computer languages (Javascript, Perl,
PHP, Java, CSS).
