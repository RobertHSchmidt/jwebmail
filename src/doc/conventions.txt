Do not commit text files with tab characters.  Your editor should have a
setting to automatically convert tabs to spaces.  If not, then use
"expand" (available for all UNIXes + Cygwin) or any other home-made or
off-the-shelf tab-expander.

Don't use liberal import statements.  Include just what you need to
prevent unnecessary name collisions in the future.

Be conservative with white space.  E.g., don't ever put white space where
it is totally useless, like blank spaces at ends of lines; or blank
lines at the very beginning of a file, the very end of a file, or
right after "{" or right before "}".

Be conservative with comments.  Do not write your development history
in the source code.  That is what we use Subversion for.

Don't let your IDE clutter our source code with garbage.  If your IDE
writes template stuff which is not exactly right and which you do not
manually correct, then change your IDE setup to not write those templates.

Don't mis-use RCS keywords.  Whether using IDE templating or not, don't
use RCS keywords in JavaDoc elements @author, @since, @version.  For
the first two, Subversion (or CVS for that matter) will keep updating
these values, but their only purpose is to record the static values at
edit time.  For the latst (@version), what the reader will want to
know is the "release version", not the change-control revision.

When making a new file, copy the Copyright (and file Id$) boilerplate from
an existing file of the same type, and update the Copyright date if necessary.

Use block indents of 2 spaces for all *.xml files (incl. *.xsl and *.dtd),
and for HTML code in *.html, *.jsp, or fragment files (because of the copious
nesting of HTML).

Use block indents of 4 for all other computer languages (Javascript, Perl,
PHP, Java, CSS).
