Ordered short-term TODO list
============================

EGAD FIXME:  This webapp kills the entire servlet container when you
try to stop the webapp from running.  Worse than that, it doesn't
even shut down the container cleanly but leaves it stuck so you have
to kill it violently.  The *Shutdown* method(s) is probably a good
place to start looking.

Fix bug in the TEA and Helper encryption/decryption routines.  Binary
characters are getting added to some Strings.  This makes valid passwords
fail in some cases (probably directly depends on characters in the real
password).

Fix IMAPS protocol.  Does not list in the authentication pulldown.
It retrieves mail using imap when I select imaps for the mail (IIRC,
this is due to somehow getting "imap://" as the protocol header for
imaps, instead of "imaps://").

Add an IMAPs config setting for alternate mail folder base directory.

Resolve NPE being thrown constantly from XMLData.getNodeXPath().

Somewhere in the callback thread, log the target document of XPath failures.

Make release build targets.

Roll an RC.  1.0.1rc1.

Stop loading resources directly from the application through the FS.
Load delivered resources through classpath.  Can load generated data from FS,
but through indirection so user has an opportunity to disassociate this data
from the application.

Determine exactly what the app writes to at runtime.
Have it use a working-directory instead of writing into the deliverable.

Get rid of the many dependencies upon ServletContext.getRealPath(), so we
can distribute a portable .war file that will run on any popular app server.

IMPORTANT:  DO NOT FORGET
If do not hear back from Kevin Excellent Lee, then revert the org.bulbul
classes back to GPL.  (Already have perm from Kowatch for webengruven).

Fix level-ambiguity in XML processing code.
FIRST verify my assertion that tree.getElementsBy*() searches for all
ancestors, not just direct children.
Do code search for use of getElementsBy...() and change to the less dangerous
and more efficient getChild*() methods.
