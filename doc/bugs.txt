This is a list of known bugs in WebMail. Some of them are bugs that I cannot
fix, because they are not directly in the WebMail code but in some third party
library or program:
==============================================================================

Mail hosts are saved, per-user, when they access a mail host (either first
time or every time).  At least when the Domains feature is used, there is
no way to update this.  E.g., when allowing only one folder access protocol
use Admin Plugin to change this protocol:  There is no way for existing
JWebMail users to use the new protocol.  (N.b. this is for folder
access, not authenticating, which correctly follows the Admin auth setting).
WORK-AROUND:
    1. Stop the webapp (no need to uninstall)
    2: Remove the user's XML data file at <DATADIR>/<DOMAIN.NAME>/<USERNAME>.xml
    1. Start the webapp
Unfortunately, just removing the <MAILHOST> element from the XML file doesn't
work.  Removing the whole file will probably lose all the users' preferences.

Non-critical XPath bug(s).  See errors in the application log.

Graceless handling of session timeouts.  Get exception stack traces in
browser if a session times out... at least for an Admin session.
I believe there is also a hardcoded reference to the old context-path
of "/webmail" somewhere, because I am sometimes redirected to
http://hostname:PORT/webmail/... after a timeout.

App has compiled-in context path.  The implications of this are:
    Needs to be recompiled just to run as the root (/) app in an app server.
    Can't have more than one deployment of JWebApp in a container.

App writes to the deployment directory.  The implications of this are:
    Will not run in app servers where app does not run directly from
     an exploded webapp directory tree.
    If user doesn't change the webmail.data.dir setting, all settings
     and data will be lost upon upgrade or redeployment.

Title:
  WU-IMAP server doesn't show recent messages in the message list
WebMail part:
  Message List, Folder overview
Description:
  You get a certain count of "recent" (or "new") messages in the folder
  overview, if you click on the message list for the folder these new
  messages are not shown.
Explanation:
  -
Solution:
  The problem doesn't exist if you use the Cyrus IMAP server


Title:
  Cannot delete messages on a POP3-Server
WebMail part:
  Message List, Message View
Description:
  It is not possible to delete messages if you use a POP3 Server
Explanation:
  The limitation is not from WebMail, but a problem of the POP3-Provider
  used by the JavaMail API. POP3 was not thought for remote message management
  and thus the message deletion support does not fit into JavaMails ideas on
  how to handle folders.
Solution:
  Either use IMAP (preferred) or try different POP3-Providers for JavaMail.
  For the latter, simply replace the file pop3.jar by the new provider.
