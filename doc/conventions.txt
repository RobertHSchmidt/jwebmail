Your goal should be code that looks like this
    http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConventions.doc10.html#182
The rest of short file explains slight additions and modifications to
Sun's code conventions,
    http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConventions.doc.html

Do not commit text files with tab characters.  Your editor should have a
setting to automatically convert tabs to spaces.  If not, then use
"expand" (available for all UNIXes + Cygwin) or any other home-made or
off-the-shelf tab-expander.

Don't use liberal import statements.  Using wild-card imports has indeed
made much extra work for me when I refactored this project.  Most times
I have to guess what package an unknown XML or utility class comes from,
because it would take too much time to search all the libraries.  It has
also caused otherwise unnecessary name collisions when upgrading or
switching third party libs, and upgrading the Java JVM.  For the same
reasons, if you copy and paste a .java file to use as a starting point
for a new class, at some point review the import statements and remove
the unnecessary ones (all IDEs can do this for you).

Nobody has ever benefitted by separating groups of import statements by
blank lines.  If there are 3 java.util imports followed by 2 java.io
imports followed by 8 net.wast.webapp imports, it couldn't be easier
to find the group you are looking for.
Just group imports sequentially (if at all), without the blank lines.

Be conservative with white space.  E.g., don't ever put white space where
it is totally useless, like blank spaces at ends of lines; or blank
lines at the very beginning of a file, the very end of a file, or
right after "{" or right before "}".
NOTE:  Don't think that I'm discouraging standard use of whitespace where
it is required to discern the tokens.  This happens a lot in this code-base,
but it is not my doing:
BAD:  int tree_depth=getFolderTree(subfolders[i],xml_folder,subscribed_only);
GOOD: int tree_depth = getFolderTree(subfolders[i], xml_folder, subscribedOnly);

Unless there is a good design reason (and sometimes there are), use camelBack
variable and member naming.  This is a JAVA product, so try to code like a
Java developer:  "subscribedOnly", not "subscribed_only".

Be conservative with comments.  Do not write your development history
in the source code.  That is what we use Subversion for.

Don't let your IDE clutter our source code with garbage.  If your IDE
writes template stuff which is not exactly right and which you do not
manually correct, then change your IDE setup to not write those templates.

Don't mis-use RCS keywords.  Whether using IDE templating or not, don't
use RCS keywords in JavaDoc elements @author, @since, @version.  For
the first two, Subversion (or CVS for that matter) will keep updating
these values, but their only purpose is to record the static values at
edit time.  For the latst (@version), what the reader will want to
know is the "release version", not the change-control revision.

When making a new file, copy the Copyright (and file Id$) boilerplate from
an existing file of the same type, and update the Copyright date if necessary.

Use block indents of 2 spaces for all *.xml files (incl. *.xsl and *.dtd),
and for HTML code in *.html, *.jsp, or fragment files (because of the copious
nesting of HTML).

Use block indents of 4 for all other computer languages (Javascript, Perl,
PHP, Java, CSS).

Miminize nesting.  Unnecessary nesting makes code more complex and more
difficult to understand for no reason (not to mention highly nested code
doesn't fit in the width of a normal editor).  Detect exceptional cases early
then handle and throw/return/continue/break and be-done-with-it, instead
of making a large if/then or if/then/else structure.

Do not System.exit() except in main() methods that will never be executed
by our running app.  Do not write to System.out or System.err.  Do not
use Thread.printStackTrace(*), which amounts to the same thing.  We have
a logging facility that makes it easy to write messages and stack traces.
NOTE:  log.*(Throwable) just logs the Throwable.toString(), but
log.*(String, Throwable) logs the stack trace.

Line wrapping convention is a minor adjustment to Sun's recommendation to
indent the consecutive lines 8 spaces.  Where it matters (screenfuls with
lots of indenting), this totally defeats the purpose by making a total
mess where you can't intuitively discern the intended blocking levels.
The reason Sun doesn't have you indent 2 or 4, is because the continuation
lines look like a new block nesting level.  To avoid the mess but also
avoid the ambiguity:
    Indent "continuation lines" by 2 additional spaces,
    EXCEPT if the line-to-be-split is a "nesting" line (i.e. is followed
    by code indented to the next level), then indent by 8 additional spaces.
If your editor or IDE does your wrapping (or reformats), then just have it
indent 2 more spaces and we'll live with the minor blocking ambiguity.
