Ordered short-term TODO list
============================

Fix IMAPS protocol.  Does not list in the authentication pulldown.
It retrieves mail using imap when I select imaps for the mail (IIRC,
this is due to somehow getting "imap://" as the protocol header for
imaps, instead of "imaps://").

Add an IMAPs config setting for alternate mail folder base directory.

Resolve NPE being thrown constantly from XMLData.getNodeXPath().

Somewhere in the callback thread, log the target document of XPath failures.

Fix bug preventing an attribution on the Bibop login page from displaying.
Says "BiBop WebMail is base on"... and nothing.

Code up a stopper for the ConnectionTimer thread which continues running
after app shutdown.

Take care of all easy compiler warnings.  All except third-party if time
permits.

If time permits, turn on lotsa compilation checks with Eclipse and take
care of the warnings.

Make release build targets.

Roll an RC.  1.0.1rc1.  (Consider waiting on following super-item).

Stop loading resources directly from the application through the FS.
Load delivered resources through classpath.

    Determine exactly what the app writes to at runtime.
    Have it use a working-directory instead of writing into the deliverable.

    Get rid of the many dependencies upon ServletContext.getRealPath(), so we
    can distribute a portable .war file that will run on any popular app server.

    Get rid of the Ant filtering and use the app.name/context.path from
    the listener.

    Verify that after this work, can deploy JWebApp with root context path.

    Document that user must assign the app.name/context.path to match
    the war file or web app directory name.

Use container-managed mail providers retrieved through JNDI.

IMPORTANT:  DO NOT FORGET
If do not hear back from Kevin Excellent Lee, then revert the org.bulbul
classes back to GPL.  (Already have perm from Kowatch for webengruven).

Fix level-ambiguity in XML processing code.
FIRST verify my assertion that tree.getElementsBy*() searches for all
ancestors, not just direct children.
Do code search for use of getElementsBy...() and change to the less dangerous
and more efficient getChild*() methods.
