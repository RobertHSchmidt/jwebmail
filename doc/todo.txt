Ordered short-term TODO list
============================

Add a POPS Authenticator.  Just get it to compile and list at this point.

Test POP protocols.

Add an IMAPs config setting for alternate mail folder base directory.

Get JSPs out of Java source directory branch.

Use packages for all classes.
Classes in */webmail/plugins and */webmail/authenticator now use default
package, which conflicts with *.java directory locations.

Resolve NPE being thrown constantly from XMLData.getNodeXPath().

Somewhere in the callback thread, log the target document of XPath failures.

Get rid of lines like "BiBo... is based on" in
src/net/wastl/webmail/data/xml/*/bibop/logout.xsl, DITTO/loinscreen.xsl.
Sentence is incomplete, and I have no idea what the intended sentence was.

More branding updates.
    Search for '\<WebMail\>' and change all but Servlet name references
    to JWebMail.  (I know of src/net/wastl/webmail/ata/xml/en/bibop/loginscr*)
    Review image for old version number and "WebMail" text.  I know of:
        src/net/wastl/webmail/data/xml/*/bibop/images/webmailtitle.gif
          (all of these are the same image)

Code up a stopper for the ConnectionTimer thread which continues running
after app shutdown.

Take care of all easy compiler warnings.  All except third-party if time
permits.

If time permits, turn on lotsa compilation checks with Eclipse and take
care of the warnings.

Make release build targets.

Roll an RC.  1.0.1rc1.  (Consider waiting on following super-item).

Stop loading resources directly from the application through the FS.
Load delivered resources through classpath.

    Determine exactly what the app writes to at runtime.
    Have it use a working-directory instead of writing into the deliverable.

    Get rid of the many dependencies upon ServletContext.getRealPath(), so we
    can distribute a portable .war file that will run on any popular app server.

    Get rid of the Ant filtering and use the app.name/context.path from
    the listener.

    Verify that after this work, can deploy JWebApp with root context path.

    Document that user must assign the app.name/context.path to match
    the war file or web app directory name.

Fix bug where existing Virtual Domain never see changes made to the
Virtual Domain config.

Use container-managed mail providers retrieved through JNDI.

IMPORTANT:  DO NOT FORGET
If do not hear back from Kevin Excellent Lee, then revert the org.bulbul
classes back to GPL.  (Already have perm from Kowatch for webengruven).

Fix level-ambiguity in XML processing code.
FIRST verify my assertion that tree.getElementsBy*() searches for all
ancestors, not just direct children.
Do code search for use of getElementsBy...() and change to the less dangerous
and more efficient getChild*() methods.

Test POPS protocols.
