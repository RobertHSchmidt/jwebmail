Ordered short-term TODO list
============================

IMPORTANT:  DO NOT FORGET
If do not hear back from Kevin Excellent Lee, then revert the org.bulbul
classes back to GPL.  (Already have perm from Kowatch for webengruven).

Somewhere in the callback thread, log the target document of XPath failures.

Resolve NPE being thrown constantly from XMLData.getNodeXPath().

Updated cos.jar  to the latest (2003/11/05) cut.
Get updated javaOTP.jar w/ webengruven OTP auth.  Version???
mbox.jar seems to be v. 1.3.3 of the obsolete knife mbox provider.

Use javax.xml.xpath instead of org.apache.xpath. in xlan.jar.

If haven't already, document requirement for JDK 1.5
(javax.xml.xpath not in 1.4).

EGAD FIXME:  This webapp kills the entire servlet container when you
try to stop the webapp from running.  Worse than that, it doesn't
even shut down the container cleanly but leaves it stuck so you have
to kill it violently.

Fix level-ambiguity in XML processing code.
FIRST verify my assertion that tree.getElementsBy*() searches for all
ancestors, not just direct children.
Do code search for use of getElementsBy...() and change to the less dangerous
and more efficient getChild*() methods.

Get all but bootstrap libs out of the code baseline.  Use Ivy to fetch libs.

Get rid of the many dependencies upon ServletContext.getRealPath(), so we
can distribute a portable .war file that will run on any popular app server.

Stop loading resources directly from the application through the FS.
Load delivered resources through classpath.  Can load generated data from FS,
but through indirection so user has an opportunity to disassociate this data
from the application.

Copy default data to webmail.data.dir upon startup, if it is present but empty.

Fix bug in the TEA encryption/decryption routines.  Binary characters are
getting added to some Strings.  This makes valid passwords fail in some
cases (probably directly depends on characters in the real password).
