Ordered short-term TODO list
============================

Resolve "Not a valid number" warnings in log, from XMLUserData (at least
upon imap login).

Update BiBop's webmail copyright message.

Get rid of lines like "BiBop... is based on" in
src/net/wastl/webmail/data/xml/*/bibop/logout.xsl, DITTO/loginscreen.xsl.
Sentence is incomplete, and I have no idea what the intended sentence was.

Widget fixes
    Remove the interaction widgets in the Admin Plugin for the disabled
    shutdown actions.

    Remove password field widgets of User Setup screen if the user's
    Authenticator does not allow changing passwords.

    Pulldown list on Create Folder screen should either not offer folder
    types not supported by the server, or detect failures to create
    unsupported folder types (or create a type that was not selected).

    Fix goofy HTML password form behavior and have it not show encrypted
    passwords.

More branding updates.
    Search for '\<WebMail\>' and change all but Servlet name references
    to JWebMail.  (I know of src/net/wastl/webmail/ata/xml/en/bibop/loginscr*)
    Review image for old version number and "WebMail" text.  I know of:
        src/net/wastl/webmail/data/xml/??/bibop/images/webmailtitle.gif
          (all of these are the same image)
        src/net/wastl/webmail/data/xml/??/*/images/login_title.png
          (all of these are the same image)
        src/net/wastl/webmail/data/xml/??/bibop/images/java_powered.png
          (all of these are the same)
          (these last seem to be a mistake.  Image has nothing to do with
          "java powered", like the corresopnding classic theme image does).

Take care of all easy compiler warnings.  All except third-party if time
permits.

Change-control an Eclipse config.

If time permits, turn on lotsa compilation checks with Eclipse and take
care of the warnings.

Add a new properties setting like webmail.demo or webmail.noxmit, to prevent
sending messages from the JWebMail server.  And a expiration for user accounts
Will need to keep a emailaddr/host list, because users could just sign up with
different JWebMail user name.

Make release build targets.

Roll an RC.  1.0.1rc1.  (Consider waiting on following super-item).

Host a demo site at jwebmail.admc.com.

-------------------------------------------
TAKE A DEEP BREATH
-------------------------------------------

Stop loading resources directly from the application through the FS.
Load delivered resources through classpath.

    Determine exactly what the app writes to at runtime.
    Have it use a working-directory instead of writing into the deliverable.

    Get rid of the many dependencies upon ServletContext.getRealPath(), so we
    can distribute a portable .war file that will run on any popular app server.

    Get rid of the Ant filtering and use the app.name/context.path from
    the listener.

    Verify that after this work, can deploy JWebApp with root context path.

    Document that user must assign the app.name/context.path to match
    the war file or web app directory name.

Folders in source folder are hidden for some reason, after copying to
another folder.  E.g. is tasy "Showing messages 1 to 2", but only 1
message is shown.

Code up a stopper for the ConnectionTimer thread which continues running
after app shutdown.

Have Domains protocol settings (non-auth) constrain user MAILHOST settings
at MAILHOST usage time, not just at creation.
At the very least, allow the Admin Plugin to view and change the user's
data (it's stored in the user's XML file, but not presented in the
user-admin section of the Admin gui).

Use container-managed mail providers retrieved through JNDI.

IMPORTANT:  DO NOT FORGET
If do not hear back from Kevin Excellent Lee, then revert the org.bulbul
classes back to GPL.  (Already have perm from Kowatch for webengruven).

Fix level-ambiguity in XML processing code.
FIRST verify my assertion that tree.getElementsBy*() searches for all
ancestors, not just direct children.
Do code search for use of getElementsBy...() and change to the less dangerous
and more efficient getChild*() methods.

Test the Knife mbox provider.  The setup for it was wrong, so it's quite
possible that it hasn't been working for 8 years now.  Since support and
update are unavailable, if it doesn't work, just drop it until have time
to test a modern (open source) mbox provider product.

Test POPS protocol.

When create Folders, they should automatically be subscribed to.

Either do not display the change link on (!HOLD_MESSAGES) Folders on the
Subscription-management screen, or at least tell the user when their
Subscription action has no effect.
