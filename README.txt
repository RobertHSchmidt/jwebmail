Documentation (other than this file) reside in the "doc" subdirectory.

The NOTICE.txt file has instructions for JWebMail users (i.e., you just
want to install and run the application), and for developers who want
to build JWebMail for customization or JWebMail-development purposes.

The LICENSE.txt file has the Apache 2.0 license which covers the base
JWebMail product.

JWebMail developers must also read the file doc/conventions.txt.
